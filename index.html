                El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, better known as Malcolm X, was an African American minister, and human rights activist who was a popular figure during the civil rights movement.
                He has always been vocal about education. He always believed education was key to human intellectual development.Malcolm X is a fascinating person to approach as an educational thinker – not because he was an academic or had any scholastic achievements but as an example of what can be achieved by someone engages in ‘homemade’ or self-education.
                But don't take it from me. Hear it from the man himself!

                <div class="item1">“My alma mater was books, a good library.... I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity.”
                    ― Malcolm X</div>
                <div class="item2">“Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.”
                    ― Malcolm X</div>
                <div class="item3">“People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by one book.”
                    ― Malcolm X</div>
                <div class="item4">“If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”
                    ― Malcolm X</div>
                <div class="item5">“We cannot think of being acceptable to others until we have first proven acceptable to ourselves.”
                    ― Malcolm X</div>
                <div class="item6">“We need more light about each other. Light creates understanding, understanding creates love, love creates patience, and patience creates unity.”
                    ― Malcolm X</div>
                <div class="item7">“Don't be in a hurry to condemn because he doesn't do what you do or think as you think or as fast. There was a time when you didn't know what you know today.”
                    ― Malcolm X</div>
                <div class="item8">“The ability to read awoke inside of me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive.”
                    ― Malcolm X,</div>
                <div class="item9">“Children have a lesson adults should learn, to not be ashamed of failing, but to get up and try again. Most of us adults are so afraid, so cautious, so 'safe,' and therefore so shrinking and rigid and afraid that it is why so many humans fail. Most middle-aged adults have resigned themselves to failure.”
                    ― Malcolm X</div>
                <div class="item10">“To me, the thing that is worse than death is betrayal. You see, I could conceive death, but I could not conceive betrayal.”
                    ― Malcolm X</div>

            <div id="conclusion">He never stopped wanting to learn. Just before his death in 1965, he maintained that one of the things he most regretted in his life was his lack of an academic education. He stated that he would be quite willing to go back to school and continue where he had left off and go on to take a degree. “I would just like to study. I mean ranging study, because I have a wide-open mind. I’m interested in almost any subject you can mention”.
